# BFS-Graph-Traversal-for-Single-Source-Shortest-Path
This program consists of a Java program and 3 dataset files, each consisting of a starting node number, and adjacency lists for the rest of the nodes. The program builds a graph from the file, and then performs a BFS graph traversal on the graph, finding the minimum distance from each node to the starting node.
