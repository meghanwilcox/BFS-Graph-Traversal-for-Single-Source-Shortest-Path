# BFS-Graph-Traversal-for-Single-Source-Shortest-Path
This program consists of a Java program and 3 dataset files, each consisting of a starting node number, and adjacency lists for the rest of the nodes. The program builds a graph from the file, and then performs a BFS graph traversal on the graph, finding the minimum distance from each node to the starting node. The program outputs the minumum distance of each node from the starting node as it is visited. In addition the program outputs a list of the distance of each node the starting node in the form of a list.
